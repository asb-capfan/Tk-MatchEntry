Tk::MatchEntry


Description:
------------

Tk::MatchEntry is an Entry widget with focus on user-friendly auto-completion.

With each character the user types in the widget, automatic completion can be 
attempted based on a list of choices you as programmer specify.

If there's more than one of the choices matching the text which the user has
entered so far, she can optionally select the desired auto-completion choice
from an up-popping listbox, either by using the mouse or by browsing them with
the Up and Down cursor keys. 

This listbox with auto-completion choices pops up automatically by default and
only shows these choices which still can match the manually entered text, i.e.
the number of displayed items usually decreases with the length of text entered
by the user.

The auto-completed part of the text in the Entry widget always gets selected so
the next manually entered character overwrites it. Thus, the auto-completion
feature never prevents the user from typing what she really wants to.
